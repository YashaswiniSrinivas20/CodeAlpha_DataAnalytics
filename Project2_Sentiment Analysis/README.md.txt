# 🛒 Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my **CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship**.  
I performed **Sentiment Analysis** on a dataset of Amazon product reviews using NLP techniques (TextBlob).  
The goal was to classify customer reviews into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** categories.
